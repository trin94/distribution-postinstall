# Ubuntu

This is my personal collection of applications I want to install on my Ubuntu machines.  
Fedora needs to be installed already.

In the root directory of this repository, run:

```shell

It will ask for the root password.

## 20 â€“ Application Sources

## 30 - Dotfiles Configuration

* Make sure that ssh is properly set up.
  On a fresh machine the following steps need to be executed:
    * Private key at the default location
    * Add identity
      ```shell
      sudo chmod -R 700 ~/.ssh 
      ssh-add
      ```

* This script assumes that bash is the default shell
* **Attention**: This script will override the `.bashrc` file

In the root directory of this repository, run:

```shell
ansible-playbook --ask-become-pass playbooks-ubuntu/30-dotfiles.yml
```

It will ask for the root password.

## 60 - Fonts
